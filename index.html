    </p>
    <p>
      A <strong>blockchain</strong> is a type of
      <mark>distributed ledger technology (DLT)</mark> that
      <del>consists</del> comprises of growing lists of records, called blocks,
      that are securely linked together using cryptography.<sup
        >[1][2][3][4]</sup
      >
      Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a
      timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree,
      where data nodes are represented by leaves). The timestamp proves that the
      transaction data existed when the block was created. Since each block
      contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a
      chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block
      linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are
      irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block
      cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.

      <br /><br />Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P)
      computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes
      collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate
      new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable,
      since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure
      by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine
      fault tolerance.[5]

      Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his
      1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted
      by Mutually Suspicious Groups."[11] Further work on a cryptographically
      secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott
      Stornetta.[4][12] They wanted to implement a system wherein document
      timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave
      Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its
      efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into
      one block.[4][13] Under their company Surety, their document certificate
      hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since
      1995.[14]

      <br /><br />The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a
      person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto
      improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to
      timestamp blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party
      and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which
      blocks are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following
      year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where
      it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.[3]
    </p>
    <h2>Structure and design</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital
      ledger consisting of records called blocks that are used to record
      transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be
      altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent
      blocks.[3][21] This allows the participants to verify and audit
      transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.[22] A blockchain
      database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a
      distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass
      collaboration powered by collective self-interests.[23] Such a design
      facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data
      security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic
      of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each
      unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem
      of double-spending. A blockchain has been described as a value-exchange
      protocol.[24] A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when
      properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record
      that compels offer and acceptance.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3><b>Blocks</b></h3>
    <p>
      Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into
      a Merkle tree.[3] Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior
      block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a
      chain.[3] This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous
      block, all the way back to the initial block, which is known as the
      genesis block (Block 0).[27][28] To assure the integrity of a block and
      the data contained in it, the block is usually digitally signed.[29]
    </p>
    <p><b>Block times</b></p>
    <p>
      The block time is the average time it takes for the network to generate
      one extra block in the blockchain. By the time of block completion, the
      included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically
      when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster
      transactions. The block time for Ethereum is set to between 14 and 15
      seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes.[34]
    </p>
    <p><b>Hard forks</b></p>
    <p><i>This section is an excerpt from Fork (blockchain) ยง Hard fork.</i></p>
    <p>
      A hard fork is a rule change such that the software validating according
      to the old rules will see the blocks produced according to the new rules
      as invalid. In case of a hard fork, all nodes meant to work in accordance
      with the new rules need to upgrade their software. If one group of nodes
      continues to use the old software while the other nodes use the new
      software, a permanent split can occur.

      <br /><br />For example, Ethereum was hard-forked in 2016 to "make whole"
      the investors in The DAO, which had been hacked by exploiting a
      vulnerability in its code. In this case, the fork resulted in a split
      creating Ethereum and Ethereum Classic chains. In 2014 the Nxt community
      was asked to consider a hard fork that would have led to a rollback of the
      blockchain records to mitigate the effects of a theft of 50 million NXT
      from a major cryptocurrency exchange. The hard fork proposal was rejected,
      and some of the funds were recovered after negotiations and ransom
      payment. Alternatively, to prevent a permanent split, a majority of nodes
      using the new software may return to the old rules, as was the case of
      bitcoin split on 12 March 2013.[35]

      <br /><br />A more recent hard-fork example is of Bitcoin in 2017, which
      resulted in a split creating Bitcoin Cash.[36] The network split was
      mainly due to a disagreement in how to increase the transactions per
      second to accommodate for demand.[37]
    </p>
    <h3><b>Decentralization</b></h3>
    <p>
      By storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates
      a number of risks that come with data being held centrally.[3] The
      decentralized blockchain may use ad hoc message passing and distributed
      networking.[38] One risk of a lack of decentralization is a so-called "51%
      attack" where a central entity can gain control of more than half of a
      network and can manipulate that specific blockchain record at will,
      allowing double-spending.[39]s
    </p>
    <p><b>Finality</b></p>
    <p>
      Finality is the level of confidence that the well-formed block recently
      appended to the blockchain will not be revoked in the future (is
      "finalized") and thus can be trusted. Most distributed blockchain
      protocols, whether proof of work or proof of stake, cannot guarantee the
      finality of a freshly committed block, and instead rely on "probabilistic
      finality": as the block goes deeper into a blockchain, it is less likely
      to be altered or reverted by a newly found consensus.[44]

      <br /><br />Byzantine Fault Tolerance-based proof-of-stake protocols
      purport to provide so called "absolute finality": a randomly chosen
      validator proposes a block, the rest of validators vote on it, and, if a
      supermajority decision approves it, the block is irreversibly committed
      into the blockchain.[44] A modification of this method, an "economic
      finality", is used in practical protocols, like the Casper protocol used
      in Ethereum: validators which sign two different blocks at the same
      position in the blockchain are subject to "slashing", where their
      leveraged stake is forfeited.[44]
    </p>
    <h3><b>Openness</b></h3>
    <p>
      Open blockchains are more user-friendly than some traditional ownership
      records, which, while open to the public, still require physical access to
      view. Because all early blockchains were permissionless, controversy has
      arisen over the blockchain definition. An issue in this ongoing debate is
      whether a private system with verifiers tasked and authorized
      (permissioned) by a central authority should be considered a
      blockchain.[45][46][47][48][49] Proponents of permissioned or private
      chains argue that the term "blockchain" may be applied to any data
      structure that batches data into time-stamped blocks. These blockchains
      serve as a distributed version of multiversion concurrency control (MVCC)
      in databases.[50] Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently
      modifying a single object in a database, blockchains prevent two
      transactions from spending the same single output in a
      blockchain.[51]:โ30โ31โ Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble
      traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized data
      verification, and that such systems are not hardened against operator
      tampering and revision.[45][47] Nikolai Hampton of Computerworld said that
      "many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome
      databases," and "without a clear security model, proprietary blockchains
      should be eyed with suspicion."[9][52]
    </p>
    <p><b>Public blockchains</b></p>
    <p>
      An advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is
      that guarding against bad actors is not required and no access control is
      needed.[30] This means that applications can be added to the network
      without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a
      transport layer.[30]

      <br /><br />Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their
      blockchain by requiring new entries to include proof of work. To prolong
      the blockchain, bitcoin uses Hashcash puzzles. While Hashcash was designed
      in 1997 by Adam Back, the original idea was first proposed by Cynthia
      Dwork and Moni Naor and Eli Ponyatovski in their 1992 paper "Pricing via
      Processing or Combatting Junk Mail".

      <br /><br />In 2016, venture capital investment for blockchain-related
      projects was weakening in the USA but increasing in China.[53] Bitcoin and
      many other cryptocurrencies use open (public) blockchains. As of April
      2018, bitcoin has the highest market capitalization.
    </p>
    <p><b>Private blockchains</b></p>
    <p>
      <i><b>See also : Distributed ledger</b></i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Permissioned blockchains use an access control layer to govern who has
      access to the network.[54] In contrast to public blockchain networks,
      validators on private blockchain networks are vetted by the network owner.
      They do not rely on anonymous nodes to validate transactions nor do they
      benefit from the network effect.[55] Permissioned blockchains can also go
      by the name of 'consortium' blockchains.[56] It has been argued that
      permissioned blockchains can guarantee a certain level of
      decentralization, if carefully designed, as opposed to permissionless
      blockchains, which are often centralized in practice.[10]
    </p>
    <p><b>Blockchain analysis</b></p>
    <p>
      The analysis of public blockchains has become increasingly important with
      the popularity of bitcoin, Ethereum, litecoin and other
      cryptocurrencies.[58] A blockchain, if it is public, provides anyone who
      wants access to observe and analyse the chain data, given one has the
      know-how. The process of understanding and accessing the flow of crypto
      has been an issue for many cryptocurrencies, crypto exchanges and
      banks.[59][60] The reason for this is accusations of blockchain-enabled
      cryptocurrencies enabling illicit dark market trade of drugs, weapons,
      money laundering, etc.[61] A common belief has been that cryptocurrency is
      private and untraceable, thus leading many actors to use it for illegal
      purposes. This is changing and now specialised tech companies provide
      blockchain tracking services, making crypto exchanges, law-enforcement and
      banks more aware of what is happening with crypto funds and fiat-crypto
      exchanges. The development, some argue, has led criminals to prioritise
      the use of new cryptos such as Monero.[62][63][64] The question is about
      the public accessibility of blockchain data and the personal privacy of
      the very same data. It is a key debate in cryptocurrency and ultimately in
      the blockchain.[65]
    </p>
    <h3><b>Standardisation</b></h3>
    <p>
      In April 2016, Standards Australia submitted a proposal to the
      International Organization for Standardization to consider developing
      standards to support blockchain technology. This proposal resulted in the
      creation of ISO Technical Committee 307, Blockchain and Distributed Ledger
      Technologies.[66] The technical committee has working groups relating to
      blockchain terminology, reference architecture, security and privacy,
      identity, smart contracts, governance and interoperability for blockchain
      and DLT, as well as standards specific to industry sectors and generic
      government requirements.[67][non-primary source needed] More than 50
      countries are participating in the standardization process together with
      external liaisons such as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
      Telecommunication (SWIFT), the European Commission, the International
      Federation of Surveyors, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
      and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).[67]

      <br /><br />Many other national standards bodies and open standards bodies
      are also working on blockchain standards.[68] These include the National
      Institute of Standards and Technology[69] (NIST), the European Committee
      for Electrotechnical Standardization[70] (CENELEC), the Institute of
      Electrical and Electronics Engineers[71] (IEEE), the Organization for the
      Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), and some
      individual participants in the Internet Engineering Task Force[72] (IETF).
    </p>
    <h3><b>centralized blockchains</b></h3>
    <p>
      Although most of blockchain implementation are decentralized and
      distributed, Oracle launched a centralized blockchain table feature in
      Oracle 21c database. The Blockchain Table in Oracle 21c database is a
      centralized blockchain which provide immutable feature. Compared to
      decentralized blockchains, centralized blockchains normally can provide a
      higher throughput and lower latency of transactions than consensus-based
      distributed blockchains.[73][74]
    </p>
    <h2>Types</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Currently, there are at least four types of blockchain networks โ public
      blockchains, private blockchains, consortium blockchains and hybrid
      blockchains
    </p>
    <h3><b>Public blockchains</b></h3>
    <p>
      A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone with an
      Internet connection can send transactions to it as well as become a
      validator (i.e., participate in the execution of a consensus
      protocol).[75][self-published source?] Usually, such networks offer
      economic incentives for those who secure them and utilize some type of a
      Proof of Stake or Proof of Work algorithm.

      <br /><br />Some of the largest, most known public blockchains are the
      bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain
    </p>
    <h3><b>Private blockchains</b></h3>
    <p>
      A private blockchain is permissioned.[54] One cannot join it unless
      invited by the network administrators. Participant and validator access is
      restricted. To distinguish between open blockchains and other peer-to-peer
      decentralized database applications that are not open ad-hoc compute
      clusters, the terminology Distributed Ledger (DLT) is normally used for
      private blockchains.
    </p>
    <h3><b>Hybrid blockchains</b></h3>
    <p>
      A hybrid blockchain has a combination of centralized and decentralized
      features.[76] The exact workings of the chain can vary based on which
      portions of centralization and decentralization are used.
    </p>
    <h3><b>Sidechains</b></h3>
    <p>
      A sidechain is a designation for a blockchain ledger that runs in parallel
      to a primary blockchain.[77][78] Entries from the primary blockchain
      (where said entries typically represent digital assets) can be linked to
      and from the sidechain; this allows the sidechain to otherwise operate
      independently of the primary blockchain (e.g., by using an alternate means
      of record keeping, alternate consensus algorithm, etc.).[79]
    </p>
    <h2><b>Uses</b></h2>
    <hr />

    />
    <p>
      Blockchain technology can be integrated into multiple areas. The primary
      use of blockchains is as a distributed ledger for cryptocurrencies such as
      bitcoin; there were also a few other operational products that had matured
      from proof of concept by late 2016.[53] As of 2016, some businesses have
      been testing the technology and conducting low-level implementation to
      gauge blockchain's effects on organizational efficiency in their back
      office.[80]

      <br /><br />In 2019, it was estimated that around $2.9 billion were
      invested in blockchain technology, which represents an 89% increase from
      the year prior. Additionally, the International Data Corp has estimated
      that corporate investment into blockchain technology will reach $12.4
      billion by 2022.[81] Furthermore, According to PricewaterhouseCoopers
      (PwC), the second-largest professional services network in the world,
      blockchain technology has the potential to generate an annual business
      value of more than $3 trillion by 2030. PwC's estimate is further
      augmented by a 2018 study that they have conducted, in which PwC surveyed
      600 business executives and determined that 84% have at least some
      exposure to utilizing blockchain technology, which indicates a significant
      demand and interest in blockchain technology.[82]

      <br /><br />In 2019 the BBC World Service radio and podcast series Fifty
      Things That Made the Modern Economy identified blockchain as a technology
      that would have far-reaching consequences for economics and society. The
      economist and Financial Times journalist and broadcaster Tim Harford
      discussed why the underlying technology might have much wider applications
      and the challenges that needed to be overcome.[83] First broadcast 29 June
      2019.

      <br /><br />The number of blockchain wallets quadrupled to 40 million
      between 2016 and 2020.[84]

      <br /><br />A paper published in 2022 discussed the potential use of
      blockchain technology in sustainable management[85]
